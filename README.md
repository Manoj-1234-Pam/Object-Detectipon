# Object-Detectipo# Object Detection using YOLOv8n

This project demonstrates how to perform object detection using the YOLOv8n model with both video files and live webcam feeds.

## Introduction

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. YOLOv8n is a lightweight version of the YOLO family that provides a good balance between speed and accuracy. This repository contains Python scripts that use YOLOv8n for object detection on video files and webcam streams.

## Requirements

To run the code, you'll need the following libraries:

- `opencv-python`
- `ultralytics`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python ultralytics



### Instructions:
1. Replace the placeholders (like `path_to_your_video.mp4`) with your actual details.
2. Save the content as `README.md` in your project directory.
3. Ensure that the `LICENSE` file exists if you mention it, or remove that part.
